    "## II. Background\n",
    "Our understanding of severe mental illness has been greatly advanced through the study of the postmortem human brain tissue (Lewis DA, *Neuropsychopharm.*, 2002; McCullumsmith, *Neuropsychopharm.* 2013). Studies of the postmortem human brain provide insight into the molecular and structural abnormalities which are thought to be the neural substrate for symptoms in these patient populations. Postmortem brain tissue samples are becoming widely recognized as providing ample opportunity to investigate these brain diseases, and a great deal of resources from the National Institute of Mental Health is going towards studies of the postmortem human brain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Postmortem studies of human brain provide an important bridge linking animal studies to neuroimaging and other *in vivo* approaches. One example of this link between animal studies and *in vivo* neuroimaging studies is reporting of brain volume abnomralities. There is a significant body of literature to implicate nearly every psychiatric illness with abnormalities in brain tissue volume as reported by structural MRI data, including major depressive disorder (Koolschijin PC et al., *Hum Brain Mapp.* 2009), bipolar disorder (Kempton MJ et al., *Arch Gen Psychiatry.* 2008), schizophrenia (Steen et al., *Br J Psychiatry.*, 2006; Boos et al., *Arch Gen Psychiatry.* 2007), and alcohol use disorder (Bae et al., *Exp Neurobiol.*, 2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "The large number of studies that report significant associations of psychiatric diagnosis with brain volume changes could reflect the true association of major mental illness with brain volume abnormalities. However, these findings might also be influenced by a variety of antemortem factors. For example, antipsychotic use has been associated with brain volume loss in monkeys chronically exposed to typical and atypical antipsychotics (Dorph-Petersen et al., *Neuropsychopharm.*, 2005). Moreover, it is widely recognized that the neuroimaging data exhibits a reporting bias in the literature (Ioannidis, *Arch Gen Psychiatry.* 2011). Thus, the abnormalities in brain tissue volume could reflect true biological differences, may be a consequence of other comorbid factors influencing brain tissue volume, or could be a product of excessive reporting bias in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how antemortem factors, such as psychiatric diagnosis, drug use, and age, together with other postmortem factors important for brain banking, influence brain tissue volume is of relevance for both clinical and basic scientists. Therefore, the present study sought to characterize the antemortem and postmortem factors influencing brain tissue volume using an existing cohort of highly characterized brain tissue specimens. Our objective was to identify which antemortem and postmortem factors influenced brain tissue volume measured at the time of tissue recovery. Our subject groups included control subjects (CTL) and those diagnosed with alcohol use disorder subjects (ETOH), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP), and schizophrenia (SCZ)."
