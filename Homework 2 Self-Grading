Question 1: Correct, although my answer did not fit the instructions of, "being concise." 

Question 2: Correct.

Question 3:Correct. I used a different method to ensure that the edges of the range were included in the runif() function 
(used as.integer to make sure that all the values were rounded to whole numbers, and used 6+1 to make sure that 6 was included 
as a possible roll), but it seems like both methods work appropriately. The result of 1000 rolls suggests that both methods do 
not unfairly bias a single roll (like 1 or 6). Also, it would be asethetically more efficienct to plot the graphs next to each
other using ggplot2. 

Question 4: Correct. I used a different method to properly throw the right number of dice n number of times. I used a matrix
function where N was the number of dice thrown and T was the number of throws. Setting this up as a function, I was able to 
manipulate both numberrs to get the distribution of frequencies. The distributions and qq plots look similar, although I did 
wonder if my last qq plot with 10,000 throws and 6 dice looked like the tails were longer than expected for a truly normal 
distribution compared to Tim's graphs, although I think this visual discrepency was due to scaling of the y-axis. The only 
reason I had this concern was because of the different method I used to round the integers of the dice rolling using the runif
function. Also, Tim's graphs are easier to interpret when they are plotted right next to each other, so I will asthetically
change my graphs to look differently next time.
